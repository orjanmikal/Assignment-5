Library chunk
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaic)
```

Reading file
```{r, include=FALSE}
colnames <- c("birth_month","gender", "birth_weight")
births <- read_fwf("Nat2017US.txt",
                   fwf_positions(start = c(13,475,504),
                                 end = c(14,475,507),
                                 col_names = colnames))
head(births)
str(births)

births$birth_month <- as.numeric(births$birth_month)
births$gender <- as.factor(births$gender)
births$birth_weight <- as.numeric(births$birth_weight)
```

Removing columns with missing weights
```{r}
births <- births %>% filter(birth_weight < 9999)
```

Saving the new file and making it smaller so I can remove the bigger file since I have low storage space
```{r}
save("births", file="births")
load("births")
```


Checking proportion of boys to girls and making a density plot
```{r}
tally(~gender, data = births, format = "percent")

ggplot (data = births, aes(x = birth_weight, fill = gender, colour=gender)) +    geom_density(alpha=0.8, adjust=3) + 
   xlab("Weight in gram") + ylab("Density") + 
     labs(title = "Density Plot")
       
```

Average birth varied by month
```{r}
birthaverage = births%>%
  group_by(birth_month) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(birth_weight))

ggplot(birthaverage, aes(x=birth_month, y= average, colour="average")) +
  geom_line()

```
